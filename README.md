# Code for the paper FLIP Reasoning Challenge 
Link to the paper: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12256`

# Data
The data will be made available on huggingface.


# Running the code
The first version of the codebase was written by Turlan while working on his master's thesis. Andreas has updated `src/local_reasoning.ipynb` and created `src/new_API_reason.py` to give a cleaner way to run the OpenAI models. 
When I get time, I will fix this up, so it is nicer.
